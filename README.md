## 📌 Objectives

- Learn how to connect Python applications to MongoDB
- Perform CRUD operations using `pymongo` and other MongoDB drivers
- Design and query MongoDB documents efficiently
- Explore aggregation pipelines, indexing, and performance optimization
- Integrate MongoDB with real-world Python applications
- Experiment with schema design, data validation, and best practices

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **MongoDB (local/Atlas)**
- **Python 3.9+**
- **PyMongo**
